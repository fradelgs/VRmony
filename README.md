# INTRODUCTION
This project has been developed for the course "**Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies**" of the MSc in *Music and Acoustic Engineering* of the *Politecnico di Milano*.

*VR-mony** is a minimalistic abstract cubic space in which the user can interact with spherical synthetic sound sources.

It is a 3D web-based application accessible both from VR headsets and from PCs.
<br><br>

# NAVIGATING THE APP
The app can be accessed either by downloading the whole repository and running it with a live server or by clicking on the following link.

<a href="https://fradelgs.github.io/VRmony">VR-mony</a>

Remember to wear your headphones and to switch on the audio of your device.

The best way to appreciate VR-mony is to access the link from the browser of a VR headset with 6 degrees of freedom.
<br><br>

## **The Book**
The homepage is just a joke.<br>
If the user knows where to touch, the app will ask him/her/them to play.

There are just two rules:
- No means no.
- Two is love, three is a chord.

## **The Room**
The user is suddenly teleported into a minimalistic tridimensional room with just a bunch of organized spheres, three lines and a user interface.

<br><br>

### **Controls**
**PC** users can move into the space, activate sounds and modify them with a mouse:

PAN/TILT : Hold the left mouse button to rotate in 3D.
<br>
DOLLY : Hold the mouse wheel to move back and forth.
<br>
MOVE : Hold the right mouse button to move horizontally and vertically.
<br>
PLAY : Left click on a sphere to activate its sound.


**VR** users will be able to see a green button on the bottom right of the screen if their device is VR-ready and clicking it they can access the VR experience and get out of it.

- 3 DoF headsets (included smartphones inside a Google Cardboard) can rotate the camera around the 3 axes and click by means of a bluetooth controller.

- 6 DoF headsets (Oculus Quest, HTC Vive) can move in 3 directions, rotate around 3 axes and use controllers to click.<br>â˜° Use the hamburger button on the left controller to exit.

### **Reference System**
Three lines with different colours constitute the reference system.

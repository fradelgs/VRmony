WebVR is a JavaScript API for creating immersive 3D, virtual reality experiences in your browser. Or simply put, allows VR in the browser over the Web.

A-Frame uses the WebVR API to gain access to VR headset sensor data (position, orientation) to transform the camera and to render content directly to VR headsets. Note that WebVR, which provides data, should not be confused nor conflated with WebGL, which provides graphics and rendering.<br>
